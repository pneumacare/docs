## What is IntentForms

IntentForms is simply a forms platform that is build for 2025. A world where AI agents are increasingly becoming a part of our lives and work. We started with a mission to build a form platform that AI agents can use for collecting data and providing you with the answers you need from your form submissions. 

With IntentForms, you can instruct any AI agent to create and publish forms in seconds, then automatically generate actionable insights and detailed reports from every submission. All with plain english, no code, curly braces, or new tools to learn.
